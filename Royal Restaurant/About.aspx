                Royal restaurant <br />
This is for the second RR restaurant which is the cnr of San Pal street and nwe ni street.<br />

Best of all the restaurants we tried in Bagan, RR2 offers Burmese, Indian and Chinese food. Flavors were great, meal sizes big (with lots of meat, often minimal at some of the other restaurants). On top of your meal, peanuts, fruit and sweets are included.<br />

The staff are great, we ate here 4 times, tried other restaurants but kept coming back. Prices were 6000-8500 kts for 2 mains and drinks so good value as well.<br />
